Snake Game in Python
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

Getting Started

Prerequisites-

->Make sure you have Python 3 and Pygame installed on your system. 
->If you don't have Pygame, you can install it using pip:


How to Play-

->The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake's body. 
->You can control the snake using the arrow keys:

->Up arrow: move up
->Down arrow: move down
->Left arrow: move left
->Right arrow: move right
->Every time you eat a piece of food, the snake grows longer and the game gets harder. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
